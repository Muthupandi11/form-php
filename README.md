# Student Registration Form

This project is a fully functional **Student Registration Form** developed by **Muthupandi**. It utilizes **AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)** for seamless data interaction without page reloads, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.

## 🔧 Features

- Fully functional registration form
- Asynchronous data submission using AJAX
- Real-time interaction without page refresh
- Backend integration with a database (using PHP & MySQL)
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- jQuery (for AJAX)
- PHP (Server-side scripting)
- MySQL (Database)

## 📦 How It Works

1. The user fills out the form.
2. AJAX sends the form data to the server asynchronously.
3. PHP processes the data and communicates with the MySQL database.
4. Responses are sent back and dynamically updated in the frontend.
